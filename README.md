# HaaC - Hacker as a Company

> A legal, ethical, community‑run way for independent hackers to do meaningful security work-**without the 9-5 cage**-while companies safely tap vetted talent.

---

## What is this?
HaaC is a community‑driven framework that connects **hackers**, **companies**, and **institutions** to ship real security outcomes: scoped missions, crowd‑pentests/VDPs, tooling, research, and training.

---

## Who is it for?
- **Hackers** who value autonomy, deep work, and impact over office hours.  
- **Companies/Institutions** that need trusted, diverse hacker expertise via a safe, repeatable process.  
- **Organizers/Mentors** who want to grow local cells and upskill the next wave.

---

## Why is it useful?
- **Freedom + Safety:** Work legally/ethically with clear rules, scopes, and safeguards.  
- **Real Impact:** Deliver missions, earn recognition, and build a public track record.  
- **Compound Learning:** Peer reviews, mentorship, workshops, and open knowledge.  
- **Trusted Bridge:** Companies get vetted teams, defined deliverables, and measurable outcomes.

---

## How it works (60-second tour)
1. **Intake & Scope** - we define the problem, guardrails, and success criteria.  
2. **Assemble** - a vetted squad (or cell) forms around the mission.  
3. **Execute** - research → testing → fixes → validation.  
4. **Review & Publish** - results reviewed, learnings shared, contributors recognized.
