# Hacker as a Company  
## A manifesto for ethical, free, and tactical hackers

Version 1.1 , 2025  
License: CC BY-SA 4.0

This manifesto is for:

- hackers and security researchers who want to stay **free and ethical**,  
- small collectives and independent teams who want to operate **legally and professionally**,  
- companies and institutions who want to collaborate with them in a **clear and trusted** way.

## Philosophy

Hacking is not a job , it is a mindset.

A hacker does not evolve in captivity.  
They learn by breaking, explore through curiosity, and build through understanding.

But the world needs structure.  
Companies need contracts, clarity, guarantees, and accountability.  
States need legality, auditability, and responsibility.

**Hacker as a Company (HaaC)** is the bridge.

A legal, ethical, and agile structure where hackers remain free and professional.

It is the synthesis of two worlds:

- the autonomy of the hacker,  
- the discipline required by companies and institutions.

**Ethics first.  
Freedom protected by structure.  
Impact guided by responsibility.**

## What Hacker as a Company Is

A “Hacker as a Company” is:

- a solo operator or small collective with a **clear legal identity**,  
  - company, self-employed, cooperative, or equivalent;  
- working **legally**, under contracts, NDAs, SLAs and defined scopes;  
- mixing revenue streams:  
  - consulting, bug bounty, research, training, building tools;  
- keeping control over schedule, direction, and methodology;  
- staying compliant, documented, and respected;  
- delivering work with integrity and autonomy.

**Legal structure, hacker soul.**

This is:

- ethics first,  
- freedom second,  
- impact always.

---

## What Hacker as a Company Is Not

HaaC is **not**:

- a license to break the law,  
- a justification for “gray-hat” mercenary hacking,  
- a shortcut to bypass compliance or regulation,  
- an exploit-trading market,  
- a bug bounty farm that burns trust.

HaaC exists to **protect** the hacker’s freedom by making it:

- **ethical**,  
- **legal**,  
- **accountable**.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Ethics First

Ethics are the foundation of Hacker as a Company.  
Without ethics, there is no trust. Without trust, there is no freedom.

Ethics at HaaC mean:

- no illegal hacking,  
- no unauthorized testing,  
- no privacy violations,  
- no harmful actions,  
- explicit consent, scope, and responsibility in every engagement.

A hacker’s integrity is their license to operate.

---

### 2. Freedom With Responsibility

Freedom is essential , but not absolute.  
It exists because responsibility protects it.

In HaaC, freedom means:

- choosing what to work on,  
- choosing when and how to work,  
- following curiosity as an engine of mastery,  
- remaining autonomous, not trapped in rigid structures,

**always** within a clear ethical and legal frame.

---

### 3. Agility With Clarity

Agility without clarity is chaos.

HaaC promotes:

- small, adaptive, tactical units,  
- clear objectives, written scopes, explicit constraints,  
- measurable outcomes and accountable reporting.

Agility is not improvisation , it is **focused efficiency**.

---

### 4. Curiosity as Fuel

Curiosity drives learning.  
Experimentation drives expertise.  
Understanding drives capability.

A hacker does not explore to exploit.  
They explore to understand , and to protect.

Curiosity is welcome.  
Recklessness is not.

---

### 5. Transparency and Trust

Trust is earned through clarity:

- scopes written and agreed,  
- risks explained,  
- communication maintained,  
- documentation produced,  
- reports delivered and owned.

A hacker remains free by being accountable.  
Transparency is the cost of independence.

---

## Legal but Free

A Hacker as a Company is:

- **legally registered**,  
- **contractually aligned**,  
- **ethically bound**,  
- **operationally free**.

Every engagement is defined by:

- consent,  
- scope,  
- clarity,  
- documented outcomes.

Integrity and accountability form the backbone of independence.
