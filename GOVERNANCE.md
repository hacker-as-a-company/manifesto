# HaaC  Governance (Phase‑0)
**Version:** 1.0 • **Status:** Pre‑operational • **Last updated:** 2025‑11‑15

This document defines how HaaC organizes decisions, roles, and accountability during **Phase‑0**. It prioritizes **trust, legality, and safety** while we build the framework and platform.

---

## 1) Purpose & principles
- **Purpose:** Organize a lawful, ethical hacker community that strengthens cybersecurity through education and structured collaboration.  
- **Principles:** legality, transparency, non‑disruption, privacy, inclusion, public benefit, and continuous learning.

---

## 2) Phases
- **Phase‑0 (you are here):** community, governance, training, labs, platform scaffolding. **No** testing of third‑party systems.  
- **Phase‑1 (future):** pilot engagements **only** where written authorization and lawful safe‑harbor/MoU exist.  
- **Phase‑2 (future):** scaled operations under clear, audited processes.

Transitions between phases require a formal **Phase Gate RFC** (see §7) and steward approval.

---

## 3) Membership & roles
- **Observer:** joins Discord/GitHub; reads and learns.  
- **Contributor:** participates in docs/labs/events; accepts the Code of Conduct & Member Pledge.  
- **Verified Member (optional in Phase‑0):** identity‑verified for future operational roles.  
- **Steward:** elected/appointed volunteers responsible for governance areas.

### Steward roles (3–5 people)
- **Community Steward:** onboarding, moderation, inclusion.  
- **Education Steward:** labs, curricula, events (labs‑only in Phase‑0).  
- **Platform Steward:** documentation, tooling, repo hygiene.  
- **Legal/Policy Liaison:** ensures materials reflect legal constraints; handles authority communications.  
- **(Optional) Operations Steward:** scheduling, metrics, reporting.

Term length: **6 months**, renewable once. Vacancies may be filled ad‑interim by a majority of remaining stewards.

---

## 4) Working groups (WGs)
Form lightweight WGs with a charter, a lead, and a public README:
- **WG‑Education**, **WG‑Platform**, **WG‑Governance**, **WG‑Comms**, **WG‑Legal‑Policy**.  
WGs publish meeting notes and roadmaps in their folders.

---

## 5) Decision‑making model
- **Lazy consensus** for routine matters (72h review window).  
- **Simple majority** of stewards for policy changes, enforcement appeals, and Phase‑gate readiness checks.  
- **Supermajority (2/3) of stewards** for adoption/amendment of Code of Conduct, Legal README, or Governance.  
- Community input is gathered via issues, PRs, and dedicated Discord threads.

Quorum for steward votes: **≥60%** of current stewards.

---

## 6) Transparency
- Publish meeting notes, decisions, and changelogs in the repo.  
- Maintain a **/status** page showing current phase, guardrails, and last review date.  
- Keep a public **roadmap** for Phase‑0 deliverables.

---

## 7) Proposals: HaaC RFCs
Any Contributor may open an RFC:
- Filename: `rfcs/NNNN-short-title.md`  
- Sections: Problem • Proposal • Alternatives • Risks • Phase impact • Rollout • Metrics  
- Review windows:  
  - Normal: 7 days for comments.  
  - Policy‑level: 14 days and at least one open call.  
- Resolution labels: **Accepted / Rejected / Needs‑Revision / Deferred**.

**Phase Gate RFCs** must include legal/operational readiness, risk assessment, and sign‑off by the Legal/Policy Liaison.

---

## 8) Conflicts of interest (COI)
Participants disclose any material COI (employment, contract, or benefit) that may affect proposals or votes. Stewards with a COI on a decision recuse themselves.

---

## 9) Moderation & enforcement
- The **Community Steward** leads incident triage; a 3‑person panel (including the Legal/Policy Liaison) decides sanctions per the Code of Conduct.  
- Sanctions may include warnings, suspensions, removals, or reporting to appropriate authorities for serious misconduct.

---

## 10) Funding & sponsorship (Phase‑0)
- Only **in‑kind** support (infrastructure, lab hosting, venue) and small community donations.  
- No commercial pentest revenue or bounty operations in Phase‑0.  
- Sponsors have **no editorial control** over policy or enforcement.

---

## 11) Document control & amendments
- These governance documents are licensed **CC BY‑SA 4.0**.  
- Amendments follow §5 (Decision‑making).  
- Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` with rationale for each revision.

---

## 12) Sunsetting & handover
If HaaC becomes inactive or transitions to Phase‑1/2 under a new legal entity, stewards will:  
- archive repos with read‑only status, or  
- transfer stewardship to a successor structure with a public notice and document handover.
