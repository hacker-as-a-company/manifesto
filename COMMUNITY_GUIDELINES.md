# HaaC Community Guidelines  
**Version:** 1.0 • **Status:** Pre-operational • **Last updated:** 2025-11-15

The **Hacker as a Company (HaaC)** community gathers hackers, builders, engineers, architects, designers, researchers, legal minds, and creators under one shared vision:

> **Empower hackers to operate ethically, legally, freely, and collaboratively as autonomous entities**

These guidelines define how we collaborate, grow, and build the movement together.

---

# 1. Our Principles

## 1. Ethics Above All  
Before anything else, HaaC is built on **strict, non-negotiable ethics**:

- No illegal hacking  
- No unauthorized testing  
- No data breaches  
- No privacy violations  
- No harm to individuals, companies, or institutions  
- Always with explicit consent and clear scope  

Ethics come first because **trust** is the foundation of everything we do.

---

## 2. Freedom With Responsibility  
Hackers do not thrive in captivity.  
A hacker’s natural state is **autonomy**, **curiosity**, and **deep focus** — not rigid schedules or hierarchical constraints.

In HaaC:

- You choose **what** you work on  
- You choose **when** you work  
- You choose **how** you contribute  
- You move at your own rhythm  
- You follow your curiosity — your strongest engine  

Freedom only exists because **ethics and responsibility** protect it.

---

## 3. Hacker Culture & Hacker Mindset  
We embrace the authentic hacker identity:

- Creativity that turns constraints into solutions  
- Persistence that digs until understanding emerges  
- Autonomy that seeks mastery, not validation  
- Discipline disguised as passion  
- Exploration driven by **why**  
- A desire to improve the world, not to break it  

Hacking is **not** an act — it is a *mindset and a way of thinking*.

---

## 4. Transparency  
Whenever possible, HaaC is open:

- Open code  
- Open roadmaps  
- Open decisions  
- Open governance  
- Open discussions  

Transparency builds trust, and trust builds community.

---

## 5. Collaboration Over Competition  
We do not compete for rank, status, or ego.

We collaborate:

- Share ideas  
- Share tools  
- Share methodologies  
- Help each other grow  
- Respect contributions at every level  

HaaC is a **collective force**, not a leaderboard.

---

## 6. Impact Over Noise  
No bureaucracy.  
No politics.  
No time-wasting.

Only meaningful work:

- Tools  
- Frameworks  
- Docs  
- Platforms  
- Training  
- Real contributions  

We build. We ship. We move.

---

# 2. Community Spaces

## 1. Platform — **https://hackerasacompany.org**  
The official HaaC layer:

- Framework  
- Governance  
- Hacker profiles  
- Learning resources  
- (Future) mission marketplace  
- (Future) crowdsourced pentesting & VDP participation  

---

## 2. GitHub — **https://github.com/hacker-as-a-company**  
Where the movement is built:

- Code  
- Projects  
- Documentation  
- Issues  
- Roadmaps  
- Contributions  

GitHub is the **engineering heart** of HaaC.

---

## 3. Discord (Labs)  
Where the community *lives*:

- Brainstorming  
- Project coordination  
- Local chapters  
- Hackathons & micro-sessions  
- Discussions, culture, memes  
- Demos, ideas, experiments  

Discord is the **lab**, not the headquarters.

---

# 3. How We Work

## A. Project Cells (Decentralized Execution)  
Each project is a **cell**:

- Clear purpose  
- A coordinator (not a boss)  
- A roadmap  
- Volunteer contributors  
- Autonomy in execution  

Cells act independently but share the same DNA.

---

## B. Geographic Cells (Local Chapters)  
**HaaC-Morocco** is the pilot.

Local chapters:

- Build local communities  
- Run meetups and hack sessions  
- Connect with local institutions  
- Adapt global tools to local realities  

HaaC is global, but **rooted** in Morocco.

---

# 4. Contribution Rules

1. **Join any project anytime**  
   Comment on the issue or jump in the Discord thread.

2. **Respect maintainers’ decisions**  
   A declined PR is not a rejection of you — only of code.

3. **Communicate with clarity and kindness**  
   No toxicity. No ego battles.

4. **Credit authors**  
   Ideas, code, drafts — attribution matters.

5. **Security first**  
   - No sensitive data in commits  
   - No real clients in examples  
   - No illegal scans  
   - No testing without authorization  

---

# 5. Identity and Culture

### 1. Hacker Spirit  
Curiosity. Creativity. Exploration. Autonomy. Creation.  
We protect that spirit at all costs.

### 2. Respect & Humility  
Beginners and experts stand on equal ground here.  
Anyone can teach something. Anyone can learn something.

### 3. Moroccan Roots, Global Reach  
The movement starts in Morocco but extends to the world.

### 4. Mission  
- Empower hackers  
- Create new economic paths  
- Strengthen national & global cybersecurity  
- Build meaningful careers and companies  
- Turn passion into impact

# 6. What HaaC Is *Not*

- Not political  
- Not an illegal hacking group  
- Not a shadow organization  
- Not a recruiting agency  
- Not just a Discord server  
- Not a place for ego or drama  

HaaC is a **legal, ethical, structured, open-source ecosystem**.

---

- Be ethical  
- Be respectful  
- Be transparent  
- Be helpful  
- Be curious  
- No harassment
