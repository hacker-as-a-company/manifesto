# HaaC — Legal README (Pre-operational)
**Version:** 1.1 • **Status:** Phase-0 • **Last updated:** 2025-11-15  
**This is not legal advice.** It describes how HaaC operates during Phase-0. Consult qualified counsel for any legal questions.

---

## 1) What HaaC is (Phase-0)
- A community building **people, frameworks, training, and platform scaffolding**.  
- Activities are **educational** and limited to **HaaC-owned or intentionally vulnerable lab environments**.  
- We **do not** test third-party systems and we **do not** run bug bounties or pentests during Phase-0.

---

## 2) What HaaC is not (Phase-0)
- Not an operator of public vulnerability disclosure or triage for third parties.  
- Not a marketplace for vulnerabilities, exploits, or offensive tools.  
- Not a substitute for professional legal advice or incident response.

---

## 3) Authorization & safe harbor
- **No scope, no test.** HaaC members must not access, probe, or test any third-party system without **written authorization** from the owner and a **lawful safe-harbor/MoU**.  
- When (and only when) such frameworks exist, activities will follow **documented scope**, **time windows**, and **non-disruption** rules.

---

## 4) Data & privacy (community operations only)
- HaaC aims to **minimize personal data**. Typical data in Phase-0: names/aliases, contact emails, Discord/GitHub handles.  
- We do not collect or store vulnerability data about third-party systems.  
- Any community data is stored with reasonable safeguards; retention is minimized and purpose-limited.  
- Members must not share other people’s personal data without consent.

---

## 5) Content & export safety
- Educational material must not enable wrongdoing.  
- No distribution of malware, live-target exploit chains, credentials, or secrets.  
- Respect export controls and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

---

## 6) Intellectual property & licenses
- Unless otherwise noted, HaaC content is released under **CC BY-SA 4.0**.  
- By contributing, you confirm you have rights to your contribution and you license it under **CC BY-SA 4.0**.  
- Trademarks, logos, and names remain the property of their respective owners; do not imply endorsement.

---

## 7) Jurisdiction & authorities
- Members must follow the laws where they operate.  
- In Morocco, HaaC seeks constructive alignment with competent authorities. HaaC does not act on behalf of any authority and makes no claims of affiliation.
