# HaaC Roadmap v1.1

> **Scope:** 12-month public plan for the Hacker as a Company movement.  
> **Why v1.1?** v1.0 listed big ambitions but missed sequencing, owners, and exit criteria. This version explicitly critiques those gaps and adds measurable checkpoints.

## What v1.0 missed (critique)
- **No reality checks:** tasks such as “launch marketplace” and “build AI tooling” lived in the same phase without dependency ordering.  
- **Missing accountability:** there were no exit criteria or owners for each milestone.  
- **Investor-style buzzwords:** “AI-native pipeline” and “global federation” were inspirational but gave contributors no clue what to ship next.  
- **No trust workstream:** legal, safe-harbor, and governance deliverables were implied but not tracked separately.  
- **Community health ignored:** onboarding, moderation, and retention were bundled into vague “community building.”

## Phase 0 - Launch (Month 0-1) - status: in progress
| Outcome | Owner(s) | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish manifesto, charter, code of conduct | Core team | Docs live with attribution footer |
| Stand up communication stack | Core + moderators | GitHub org, Discord waitlist, newsletter list |
| Publish `hackerasacompany.org` v1 | Web cell | Home, manifesto, roadmap, join, legal pages live |

## Phase 1 - Foundation (Months 1-3)
### 1A. Platform Core MVP
- Static mission marketplace with 3 pilot missions listed.
- Basic identity layer (GitHub-linked profile, signed CLA, NDA template).
- Documentation library (guides, templates) synced from repo.
- Discord ↔ GitHub automation (issue feed, onboarding bot).

**Exit criteria:** hackers can introduce themselves, claim a mission, submit work, and have it reviewed inside GitHub/Discord without spreadsheets.

### 1B. Governance and Legal
- Safe-harbor template localized for Morocco and generic global use.
- Written contribution system (roles, review SLA, escalation path).
- Code of conduct enforcement guide + incident intake form.
- Draft VDP legal framework reviewed by external counsel.

**Exit criteria:** any partner can copy safe-harbor + VDP kit and know who is accountable for triage/enforcement.

### 1C. Community Building
- Onboarding guide with 3 personas (hacker, mentor, organizer).
- Welcome channels staffed 2x per week.
- Contribution playbook + readme updates.
- Selection of cell leads + weekly community call notes.

**Exit criteria:** first 25 contributors know where to ask, what to build, and who reviews.

## Phase 2 - Tools & Intelligence (Months 3-6)
### 2A. AI-Augmented Ops
- Recon + pentest orchestrator prototype (open-source repo).  
- AI-assisted mission triage (LLM script with human-in-loop).  
- Doc automation helpers (report template autopopulation).  
- GitHub issue triage agent for tagging and deduplication.

### 2B. Crowdsourced Pentesting Engine
- Submission portal (initially GitHub issue template + helper bot).  
- Scoreboard MVP (static site that reads mission stats).  
- Triage workflow doc and checklists.  
- Reputation system v0 (points for merged work, verified disclosure).

### 2C. Open-Source Projects
- HaaC Scanner core modules.  
- Pentest methodology guide.  
- Red-team playbook outline.  
- SOC analysis toolkit skeleton + curated parsers.  
- Report, script, and charter templates.

**Exit criteria:** companies can run a small-scale crowdsourced pentest with documented workflow, and contributors can reuse shared tooling.

## Phase 3 - Operations (Months 6-9)
- **Formal VDP Program:** Onboard 3 volunteer companies, set response SLAs, integrate AI triage, provide dashboard/reporting.  
- **First Paid Missions:** Deliver 2 pentest pilots for Moroccan SMEs, including invoicing, SLAs, and retests.  
- **Verified Hacker Track:** Identity verification checklist, reputation badges, mentorship pairings.  
- **Geographic expansion:** HaaC-Morocco operational handbook, scouting for France + MENA coordinators.

**Exit criteria:** proof that real companies can sign, pay, receive fixes, and cite satisfied outcomes.

## Phase 4 - Scale (Months 9-12)
- Full mission marketplace with paid listings, training calls, pentest/red-team/forensics offerings.  
- Reputation system 2.0 (rank, specialization tags, contribution tracking, fair earning distribution logic).  
- Partner ecosystem: 2 legal partners, 1 university, 1 training center, early government liaison.

**Exit criteria:** sustainable inflow of missions, transparent earnings split, and partner agreements in writing.

## Phase 5 - Maturity (Year 2+)
- International chapters with shared governance.  
- VDP Morocco formal partnership signed.  
- Annual HaaC Summit with published proceedings.  
- AI-native pentest pipeline (continuous recon -> validation).  
- Global federation (HaaC-EU, HaaC-Africa, HaaC-Asia) charter.  
- Funding model (co-op, grants, or hybrid) documented.  
- Legal recognition of the “Hacker Company” entity.

**Exit criteria:** HaaC operates as a federated movement with recurring funding and recognized legal status.
